\title{Extract coefficients from a ridgereg_qr model}
\usage{
\method{coef}{ridgereg_qr}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A `ridgereg_qr` model object returned by [ridgereg_qr()].}

\item{...}{Unused; included for S3 method compatibility.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector (typically named) of coefficient estimates,
  including the intercept as the first element.
}
\description{
This is the S3 `coef()` method for objects of class `ridgereg_qr`. It
returns the estimated regression coefficients from a model fitted using
the QR-based ridge regression solver.
