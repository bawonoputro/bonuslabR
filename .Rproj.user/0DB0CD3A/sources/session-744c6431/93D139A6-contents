#' Extract coefficients from a ridgereg model
#'
#' This is the S3 `coef()` method for objects of class `ridgereg`. It returns
#' the fitted ridge regression coefficients.
#'
#' @param object A `ridgereg` model object returned by [ridgereg()].
#' @param ... Unused; included for S3 method compatibility.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector (or named numeric vector) of coefficient estimates,
#'   including the intercept as the first element.
