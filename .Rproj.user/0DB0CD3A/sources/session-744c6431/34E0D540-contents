#' Extract coefficients from a ridgereg_qr model
#'
#' This is the S3 `coef()` method for objects of class `ridgereg_qr`. It
#' returns the estimated regression coefficients from a model fitted using
#' the QR-based ridge regression solver.
#'
#' @param object A `ridgereg_qr` model object returned by [ridgereg_qr()].
#' @param ... Unused; included for S3 method compatibility.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector (typically named) of coefficient estimates,
#'   including the intercept as the first element.
